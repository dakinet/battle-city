🕹️ Battle City Multiplayer (2-Player Edition)
🎮 Concept Overview
This project is a modernized multiplayer version of the retro classic Battle City. It allows two players to play together over a network connection, each from their own Windows computer. The goal is to retain the nostalgic aesthetic and gameplay of the original while adding smooth multiplayer support.

✨ Key Features
🔫 Two-player real-time multiplayer gameplay

🧱 Original mechanics: tank movement, shooting, brick wall destruction

🧠 Enemy tanks with classic AI behavior

🖥️ Fullscreen support

🎮 Keyboard controls (arrows to move, spacebar to shoot)

🟨 Pixel-art graphics inspired by the original game

⚙️ Technical Architecture
Component	Technology
Frontend	React (game UI & rendering)
Backend	Node.js + Express
Networking	WebSockets via Socket.io
Game State	Server-authoritative with client prediction
🧩 Implementation Plan
🧱 Phase 1: Core Game Engine & Setup
Environment Setup

create-react-app for frontend

Node.js + Express backend

Socket.io integration

Project structure and build tooling

Rendering System

Canvas-based rendering in React

Sprite loading and animations

Basic game loop with requestAnimationFrame

Core Mechanics

Tank movement & collisions

Projectile logic and destruction

Brick wall rendering & damage

Power-up system (original style)

🌐 Phase 2: Multiplayer Logic
Networking

Real-time WebSocket communication

Custom message formats for state updates

Server-maintained game state

Client-Server Interaction

Input handling and synchronization

Server authority model with prediction

Connection handling and reconnection support

Lobby & Session Management

Room creation and joining

Game start/end coordination

Graceful player disconnection handling

🤖 Phase 3: AI & Enemy Tanks
Tank AI Types

Basic: random movement and shooting

Fast: quick but fragile

Power: strong firepower

Armor: slow but highly resistant

Behavior Patterns

Random patrol

Player tracking (line of sight)

Base targeting

Wall breaking to reach player or base

Group formation logic

🗺️ Phase 4: Maps & User Interface
Map System

Load original and custom maps

Stage progression

Map editor (optional)

User Interface

Start menu and lobby UI

In-game HUD: lives, score, level

Settings (controls, audio)

Fullscreen toggle

🎨 Phase 5: Polish & Optimization
Audio

Classic sound effects (shooting, explosions)

Background music

Visual Effects

Explosion animations

Particle effects

Screen shake, feedback

Performance

Optimized canvas rendering

Minimal network traffic

Input latency reduction

Testing

Cross-browser testing

Lag & packet loss simulation

Bug fixing and balancing

🌐 Networking Details
🖧 Architecture
Central Node.js server (can be cloud-hosted or run by a player with port forwarding)

WebSocket connection via Socket.io

Server maintains authoritative state, clients send inputs

🔁 Connection Flow
Player 1 creates a room and shares code

Player 2 joins using room code

Server syncs game state and starts the game

📡 Synchronization
Inputs: move & shoot actions sent to server

Server: validates, updates, and broadcasts state

Clients: render based on server state and interpolate for smooth gameplay

🧠 NPC AI Behaviors
Type	Description
Basic	Random movement, occasional shooting
Fast	High speed, low armor
Power	High damage, moderate armor
Armor	Very slow, extremely durable
Behavior Modes:

Patrol

Player detection and pursuit

Base targeting

Obstacle destruction

Coordinated group movement

🖥️ Fullscreen Support
Toggle with fullscreen button

Uses Fullscreen API

Responsive scaling with pixel-perfect rendering

Maintains correct aspect ratio and gameplay area
